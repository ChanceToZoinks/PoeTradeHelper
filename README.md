# PoeTradeHelper

A package designed to 'help' you trade in Path of Exile. You need some special images to make it function properly.
Those will be uploaded when the project is finished.

Usage:



from PoeTradeHelper import TradeHelper

c = CentralControl()



The class CentralControl should handle everything automatically from there assuming you've got the proper screenshots and
file paths setup, but some things can be manually called if you'd like and the methods are all exposed so it's possible to
create custom behaviors.
