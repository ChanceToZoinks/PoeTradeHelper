# PoeTradeHelper

A package designed to 'help' you trade in Path of Exile. You need some special images to make it function properly.
Those will be uploaded when the project is finished.

Usage:

from PoeTradeHelper import TradeHelper
c = CentralControl()

The class CentralControl should handle everything automatically from there assuming you've got the proper screenshots and
file paths setup.
